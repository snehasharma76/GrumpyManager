GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=your_sheet_id
```

### Google Sheets Setup
1. Create a Google Sheet with two worksheets:
   - Task_Log
   - OKR_Log
2. Set up the columns as described in the Data Structure section
3. Share the sheet with your Google Service Account email

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Place Google service account credentials in `config/credentials.json`
4. Run the bot: `python src/main.py`

## Usage Guide

### Bot Commands
- `/start`: Start the bot and get a welcome message
- `/help`: Display available commands
- `/task [Priority] [Description] -c [Category] -d [YYYY-MM-DD] -a [Assignee]`: Add a new task
  - Example: `/task P1 Draft investor email -c Partnerships -d 2025-07-15 -a teammate`
- `/mytasks`: View your open tasks
- `/alltasks`: View all team members' tasks
- `/duetasks`: View tasks sorted by due date
- `/syncokrs`: Sync OKRs from Google Sheet

### Task Management
1. **Adding Tasks**:
   - Use the `/task` command with priority (P1, P2, P3)
   - Add a category with the `-c` flag (optional, defaults to "General")
   - Add a due date with the `-d` flag in YYYY-MM-DD format (optional)
   - Assign tasks to teammates with the `-a` flag (optional, defaults to yourself)
   - Example: `/task P1 Update website content -c Marketing -d 2025-07-10 -a teammate`

2. **Viewing Tasks**:
   - Use `/mytasks` to see your open tasks
   - Use `/alltasks` to see tasks for all team members
   - Use `/duetasks` to see tasks sorted by upcoming due dates
   - Tasks in `/mytasks` and `/alltasks` are sorted by priority (P1 first)
   - Tasks in `/duetasks` are grouped by due date (earliest first)
   - Each task has a "Mark as Done" button

3. **Completing Tasks**:
   - Click the "Mark as Done" button on any task
   - You'll be presented with two options:
     - "‚úÖ Mark as Done (No Link)" - Completes the task immediately without a link
     - "üìé Add Link to Completed Work" - Allows you to submit a link to your work
   - If you choose to add a link, enter a valid URL starting with http:// or https://
   - The task will be updated in Google Sheets with completion status and optional link
   - You'll receive a confirmation message showing the completed task details

### Task Assignment Notes

- When using the `-a` flag to assign tasks, provide the Telegram username **without** the @ symbol
- For usernames with underscores (e.g., `Sethu_Raman_O`), make sure to include the full username
- Example: `/task P1 Create presentation -c Marketing -a Sethu_Raman_O`
- If the assignee doesn't have a Telegram username set, they'll need to create one in their Telegram settings

### Troubleshooting

1. **Task Assignment Issues**:
   - Ensure you're using the correct format for the username (no @ symbol)
   - Check that the username exists and is spelled correctly
   - Verify that the user has set up a Telegram username

2. **Link Submission Issues**:
   - Make sure to provide a valid URL starting with http:// or https://
   - If you don't see the two options after clicking "Mark as Done", restart the bot
   - If you encounter any errors during link submission, check the bot logs
   - Links are stored in the "Completion_Link" column in Google Sheets

3. **Google Sheets Integration**:
   - Ensure the service account has edit access to the Google Sheet
   - Check that all required columns exist in the sheet
   - The bot will automatically create missing columns as needed

### OKR Management
1. **Syncing OKRs**:
   - Use `/syncokrs` to sync OKRs from Google Sheets
   - The bot will sync OKRs and display a summary of all active OKRs
   - OKRs are grouped by owner for easy reading

2. **OKR Progress Calculation**:
   - Progress is calculated based on the journey from start value to target value
   - Formula: `(current_value - start_value) / (target_value - start_value) * 100%`
   - The summary shows the complete journey: `start_value ‚Üí current_value ‚Üí target_value`
   - This provides a clear picture of progress made from the starting point

3. **Required OKR Sheet Structure**:
   - `OKR_ID`: Unique identifier for each OKR
   - `Goal_Name`: Name or description of the objective
   - `Owner`: Person responsible for the OKR
   - `Start_Value`: Initial value at the beginning of the period
   - `Current_Value`: Current progress value
   - `Target_Value`: Target value to achieve
   - `Period_Start_Date`: Start date in YYYY-MM-DD format
   - `Period_End_Date`: End date in YYYY-MM-DD format

4. **Updating OKR Progress**:
   - During end-of-day summary, you'll see OKR update buttons
   - Click on an OKR to update its progress
   - Enter the new progress value when prompted
   - Receive feedback on your progress
